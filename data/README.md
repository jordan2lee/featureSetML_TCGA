# manual_remove_mi

temp fix where all miRNA features were removed from molecular files of `KIRCKICH` and `LIHCCHOL`

this is so that I could run the feature selection on the v8 tarball that would be equiv to the v9 tarball

# ft_selection_skgrid

includes summary file of all OHSU results `skgrid_featuresets_<date>.tsv`
