# then is this number more or less than we expect randomly -- we can do a null model
# what if those 2 groups picked randomly any genes (from orig matix) > until fill
# then repeat 100 times (check for more correlations, but could do 2 tailed )
# ---eventually play with pval thres
# then plot distribut of this null model
