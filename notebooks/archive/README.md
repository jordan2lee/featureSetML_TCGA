# heatmap_topmodel.ipynb

Created around 11/24/20 to create a feature list of the one best model (best across all teams and models)
Was then used as input to create heatmap

Since then, has been copied and altered to fit current needs (best model per team heatmap)

# TMP - heatmap of molecular data, feature overlap

this figure packet created of molecular heatmaps. sent to mini subgroup (Chris, Christina, and BK). this contains heatmaps of raw molecular files. comments from group was to scale the data. note that `scaled - TMP - heatmap of molecular data, feature overlap` file was the result of this comment

# scaled - TMP - heatmap of molecular data, feature overlap

figure packet of molecular heatmaps. sent to mini subgroup (Chris, Christina, and BK) for thoughts. Comments from subgroup that the slides show all 5 data platforms were scaled, but in fact we really only need to scale 3 data types (aka skip scaling CNVR and MUTA) because it doesnt make sense to. since they are numeric or integer values. thus this will be kept in archieve
