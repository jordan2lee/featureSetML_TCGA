The current feature lists are collected in this file. Each row is a feature. Each column is a feature list. "0" or "1" indicates membership status in a feature list with "1" signifying membership. There is a special column, "total_number_of_lists", to record how many lists a feature participates in. Also, there are 3 special rows: "feature_list_method", "feature_list_cohort", "feature_list_size". The rows are sorted in descending order based on "total_number_of_lists" column.

The file records the data for:
24664 features
1272 feature lists
```
